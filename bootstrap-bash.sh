# Instructions for using this file:
#  0) Never source this file directly from the Git repository!
#  1) Audit source code to verify that it does things securely and to your
#     liking
#  2) When booting a machine:
#       a) clone your user profiles repo into /var/lib/dotfiles
#       b) copy this file into /etc/skel/.bash_profile
#       c) Copy a GPG keyring containing trusted public keys into /var/lib/dotfiles/gpg
